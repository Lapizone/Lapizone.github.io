              <h5><b>The Starbucks Story</b></h5>
              <img
                src="https://starbucks.ph/images/img_aboutus1.jpg"
                class="abouti img-fluid mx-auto"
              />
              <p class="info-text">
                Back then, the company was a single store in Seattle's historic
                Pike Place Market. From just a narrow storefront, Starbucks
                offered some of the world's finest fresh-roasted whole bean
                coffees. The name, inspired by Moby Dick, evoked the romance of
                the high seas and the seafaring tradition of the early coffee
                traders.
              </p>

              <p class="info-text">
                In 1981, Howard Schultz (Starbucks chairman and chief executive
                officer) had first walked into a Starbucks store. From his first
                cup of Sumatra, Howard was drawn into Starbucks and joined a
                year later.
              </p>

              <p class="info-text">
                In 1983, Howard traveled to Italy and became captivated with
                Italian coffee bars and the romance of the coffee experience. He
                had a vision to bring the Italian coffeehouse tradition back to
                the United States. A place for conversation and a sense of
                community. A third place between work and home. He left
                Starbucks for a short period of time to start his own II
                Giornale coffeehouses and returned in August 1987 to purchase
                Starbucks with the help of local investors.
              </p>
              <p class="info-text">
                From the beginning, Starbucks set out to be a different kind of
                company. One that not only celebrated coffee and the rich
                tradition, but that also brought a feeling of connection.
              </p>

              <h5><b>Starbucks in the Philippines</b></h5>
              <img
                src="https://starbuckscard.ph/sbcard-admin/storage/app/public/about-us/202203/MnYIFu4OaYZVZpSKUZdBWrcGw9wJ8lxe24Jysp7Q.jpeg"

              />
              <p class="info-text">
                In December 4, 1997, the Philippines had its first taste of the
                Starbucks Experience with its very first branch at the 6750
                Ayala Building in Makati City. Starbucks has since won the
                hearts of the Filipinos.
              </p>

              <p class="info-text">
                The opening of the 6750 Ayala store marked an important
                milestone in our history – the Philippines became the third
                market to open outside North America.
              </p>

              <p class="info-text">
                The tradition of warm hospitality, constant need for connection,
                and love for coffee – these are the qualities that make
                Starbucks Coffee and the Filipino people a great culture fit.
              </p>

              <h5><b>More than just coffee</b></h5>
              <img
                src="https://starbucks.ph/images/img_aboutus2.jpg"
                class="abouti img-fluid mx-auto"

                Our mission: With every cup, with every conversation, with every
                community– we nurture the limitless possibilities of human
                connection. Today, with more than 30,000 stores in more than 75
                markets, Starbucks is the premier roaster and retailer of
                specialty coffee in the world. And with every cup, we strive to
                bring both our heritage and an exceptional experience to life.
              </p>

              <p class="info-text">
                Every day, we go to work hoping to do two things: share great
                coffee with our friends and help make the world a little better.
                It was true when the first Starbucks opened in 1971 and it’s
                just as true today.
